💧 Annual Water Consumption Analyzer

A simple Python-based data analysis project that collects monthly water usage data and generates visual insights using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

This program helps users analyze their yearly water consumption through graphical representations and a summary report.

📌 Features

📥 Accepts monthly water usage input (12 months)

📊 Generates a Bar Graph for monthly comparison

🥧 Generates a Pie Chart for yearly distribution

📈 Calculates:

Total annual water consumption

Average monthly consumption

Month with highest usage

Month with lowest usage

📝 Displays a structured yearly analysis report

🛠️ Tech Stack

🐍 Python

🔢 NumPy

🗂️ Pandas

📊 Matplotlib

📂 How It Works

The user enters water consumption (in litres) for each of the 12 months.

Data is stored in a list and converted into:

A Pandas DataFrame (for bar chart visualization)

A NumPy array (for statistical calculations)

The program generates:

📊 Bar chart showing monthly usage

🥧 Pie chart showing distribution across the year

Finally, it prints a detailed yearly consumption report.

📊 Output Includes

Total Water Consumption (Yearly)

Average Monthly Consumption

Maximum Consumption Month

Minimum Consumption Month

💡 Possible Improvements

Add input validation for negative values

Save report as CSV or PDF

Add comparison between multiple years

Add water-saving recommendations

Convert into a GUI application
